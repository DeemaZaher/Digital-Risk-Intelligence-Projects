# 🛰️ Digital Risk Intelligence Projects

A portfolio demonstrating OSINT-driven investigations across **External Attack Surface Management (EASM)**, **Digital Risk Protection (DRPS)**, and **Dark Web Monitoring (DWM)** workflows — all built ethically using publicly available data and passive reconnaissance tools.

---

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🧱 Attack Surface Assessment (EASM)
Simulated external reconnaissance to identify exposed services and open ports using **Shodan** and **Censys**.  
Demonstrated how continuous EASM scanning helps reduce an organization’s digital footprint and prevent exploitation.

---

### 🛡️ Digital Risk Protection (DRPS)
Assessed brand impersonation, credential leaks, and domain reputation using **Namechk**, **Scamadviser**, **HIBP**, **URLVoid**, and **VirusTotal**.  
Simulated how DRPS workflows detect and mitigate early indicators of fraud, impersonation, and credential exposure.

### 🌑 Dark Web Monitoring (DWM)
Used **DeHashed**, **Leak-Lookup**, **SOCRadar**, and **Darkfeed.io** to monitor data leaks and threat actor activity across underground forums.  
Highlighted how dark web intelligence contributes to proactive breach detection and ransomware trend analysis.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- OSINT & Passive Reconnaissance  
- Digital Risk & Exposure Monitoring  
- Threat Feed Correlation  
- Brand & Credential Intelligence  
- Ethical Intelligence Collection  
- Report Writing & Markdown Documentation

## ⚖️ Ethical Note
All work was performed using **public, passive data sources** in accordance with responsible disclosure and OSINT best practices.  
No intrusion, exploitation, or unauthorized scanning was conducted.
